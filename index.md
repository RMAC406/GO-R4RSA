This is a goal-oriented approach to introduce non-programmers to R and Rstudio using 
gapminder data. The lessons were adaprted from the 'R for Reproducible Research' lesson, 
with the intent of demonstrating programing concepts and useful features for anlysis. 
Particualry,effort was made to get to fun stuff (i.e. making plots) as quick as possible, 
and then modify plots in ways that might be interesting and useful.

The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write modular code
and best practices for using R for data analysis. R is commonly used in many
scientific disciplines for statistical analysis and its array of third-party
packages. We find that many scientists who come to Software Carpentry workshops
use R and want to learn more. The emphasis of these materials is to give
attendees a strong foundation in the fundamentals of R, and to teach best
practices for scientific computing: breaking down analyses into modular units,
task automation, and encapsulation.

Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the
programming language R, and will not teach statistical analysis.

The lesson was reorganized and with the intent of filling 2 3hour sessions. 

A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. These
are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are
packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their
usability.

>
> Understand that computers store data and instructions (programs, scripts etc.) in files.
